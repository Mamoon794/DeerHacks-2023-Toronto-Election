time Toronto was a City of Hope life was more affordable then even though my dad had mental illness and he had trouble holding down a job my mother with one single income as a hotel made was able to pay the rent and feed the kids me and the family that is not possible today back then my home was not a safe place my dad took out his frustration his bitterness on my mother violently physically when I graduated from University I found a job I found a place to live a little basement a bit dark in Kensington Market one night I got a call from my mom she was hysterical she was in pain she was crying for help my dad heard her really badly and I said to my mom get to the hospital do it now she got patched up she was discharged but where would she go but because I had a basement apartment she was able to stay with me she found a safe haven and began the next chapter of her life today there are people that cannot find that Safe Haven today there are over a hundred thousand families single people that are waiting for affordable housing waiting for a decade or more some die waiting that could be my mother your mother or your neighbors and that's not right we urgently need to build a city that cares we have to make a city that is more affordable it is still a great City this wonderful Toronto but it needs to be a great City for everyone a few weeks ago I attended a visual it was a visual for a young man Gabriel who was killed at the queue station the cries of the mother and what she said still stayed with me even when she was totally overcome with grief with pain unimaginable pain she asked us to take care of each other to lift each other up to create better social conditions so people won't get into a crisis situation she asked us to come together and work for change I understand grief and sorrow in a different way I felt Darkness closing in when my life partner my soul mate in life in love in work passed away with the support of many I chose to fight despair and to continue to remain hopeful to make changes to make the world the city a better place to be one thing I learned in the last eight years being co-founded The Institute for change leaders is that we are stronger together I worked and I trained thousands of people to give them the voice to get them to feel the power they have within and come together and work for Change and get results and we got results I know how to get results when I was a city councilor when I was a children's advocate I ask kids across the city what would you do if you become the mayor and some kids said playground play Space better Park some say even Bill morsien Tower seriously that is true one of them said Sylvia said I asked God to give us more money for groceries and I thought wow she must have felt hunger she must have seen her mother not able to pay for groceries I could not stand by so what I did was expanded that children nutrition program that I helped started and now today it feed 200 000 kids in school every day when I imagine my mom and all her friends that couldn't speak English when they call 9-1-1 when they're desperate and I thought oh my God we need to do something but I cannot stand by so after fighting at the Police Service Board several times we finally got 9-1-1 speaking now over 200 languages these are real solutions that change people's lives for the better that is who I am I've done it before I'm here to do it again right now people across Toronto feel stuck they're stuck in traffic stuck waiting for buses stuck waiting for affordable housing waiting for parks and recs program waiting for better child care they're stuck even waiting for 9-1-1 six minutes on average my God that's not acceptable in Toronto we have a choice we can give in to pessimism stand by and do nothing or we can get unstuck we can listen to the mothers Somali mothers that have a saying that when we come together we can mend a crack in the sky yes we can man cracks in our city I've made a choice I choose to run as mayor of Toronto I love this city choose me and together we will build a city that is more caring safer more affordable where everyone belongs thank you questions no questions oh there's a mic oh okay I have a bit of a hearing problem so be loud go grab the mic we can pass the mic along and yeah hi Olivia Mark McAllister yeah if you can lift up the mic because you're taller than a mic yes excellent first question I'm sure everybody wants to ask you is why did you want to come back when you had stepped away from a public life so many years ago yeah it wasn't a easy decision to step back in but watching Mom's waiting for affordable housing watching seniors waiting I have a friend Yang that I've been waiting for more than 10 years watching people stuck in traffic watching people have to keep dialing in order to get the parks and rec program they want and 9-1-1 For Heaven's Sake waiting for more than six minutes sometimes I've experienced it calling 9-1-1 for my dad that's not acceptable I can't stand by I feel that I have the experience I have the passion I know how to work across the aisle with people of different political stripe I know how to bring people together I know how to get things done that's why today I made a choice I'm running for mayor your last attempt at running from Air obviously didn't go that well what makes things different this time around from the last time last time yes it did not turn out to be that I became a mayor one thing I learned I learned a lot of lessons the key one was that it's okay if I my English is not perfect it's okay I don't need to read a speech I could trust the Decades of experience I have I will do fine I can be more genuine and authentic by just speaking what I have in my mind I I can feel more confident even though my English is not perfect most of your competitors registered on the first day two weeks ago you decided to wait a couple weeks why did you wait a couple weeks and did anything change did you make up your mind in the last couple weeks or did you already know and you just wanted to wait why the way the question is why did I wait this long uh well there are several reasons I had to make a decisions I also have to take a leave of absence from an organization that I love a lot and I've committed to doing these trainings especially for people that are really involved in housing and I needed to make sure that uh that things could continue and I took a leap of absence and it took a bit of time I want to be responsible I don't want to just walk away this is a really crowded field I believe that there's now 47 candidates running uh do I make the 48 I'm the 47. okay this is not a bad number okay there's there's obviously a lot of high profile candidates on how what makes you believe that you can make yourself stand out enough to Toronto voters large number of people running for office they must care passionately about the city may have different ways to getting a better City but what make me stand out is that I love oh there's more singing uh what makes me stand out in this crowded field is that I have the experience I have the strength I know how to bring people together I know how to get results and that is what I will do and I've done them before I will do it again and I believe that together we can create a city that is more caring more affordable and safer for everyone where they feel they belong I could do it we can do it together and I think the key difference is I want to bring people into City Hall I believe that power comes when people come together it's not just one mayor one city council it's about all of us connecting with each other and working together achieving results together you are going to cost a lot of money the city is very tight for money at the moment how would you do this would you raise taxes higher than they already are to to fund programs I will have a full platform you expect that from me of course how will I fund the services that I talked about there are different ways which I will expand on but one of the things that I know being a former member of Parliament that I know the federal government can do so much more that's where the money is our federal and provincial government I also know that when the citizens and the residents of Toronto come together and say to other levels of government that Toronto is a financial center we are a proud City we don't want to go through the annual ritual humiliating ourselves begging for Crumbs from other levels of government we surely can do better I've gotten things done in the federal government in the House of Commons and I will fight hard for the city with the people of Toronto to get our fair share to get a new deal that can grow with the economy if we don't do that we are in trouble a couple of weeks to think this through would taxes be increased to to you know do the city's part of it that's something that that the province has has definitely said that they want to see that the city come to the table with more so would taxes go up under and Olivia child mayor show well uh the the provincial government you said I believe they are doing on all the they are asking the city to uh to do any number of things but look I've been on the budget committee for 10 years what is a budget a budget is about our priorities what the city needs I know how to do a balanced budget right now we have a bit of a budget hole of 1.5 billion dollars we can do better than that I know because I've been in the budget committee working across the aisle getting things done hi Olivia soon to come but there are a lot of big a lot of candidate future of Ontario Place infrastructure on the TTC safety policing budget things of that nature are there any big platform promises you want to make now big platform today I'm just announcing I'm running hang tight hang tight anything big will come later but I do know that that Mega Luxury Spa down by the Waterfront is not what I want and not what torontonians wants I take my grandkids there I ride my bike I run haven't swam there yet but I watched the sunset there's a beautiful place it's a magnificent place I don't want it going from public space to a private Spa where you have to pay a lot of money to get there and it's a bit weird to move uh Sign Center down there that doesn't make sense either because I think the folks up in Flemington Park and all the neighborhood needs Science Center there so there will be big platform being announced later and I hope you'll be there when I make those announcements absolutely here their powers many candidates have been forward about not shying away from using them if they feel it's necessary is that something you're also open to doing not science oh okay okay I'm an I'm a Democrat I'm known to be a Democrat I spend a lot of part of my speech about working together and I know how to work together with people across different political stripe whether it was Mel lastman the nobody Mayors you might recall it was under Mel lastman who was a conservative device I suspect uh that we got those Child Nutrition programs free dental care for kids and lots and lots of wonderful program so I know how to work with other council members and I don't think it's a democratic thing to say my way or the highway that's not how I work two-part question so the the first piece uh you know you've mentioned just now you you are a new democrat how will the organizer left be uh working to help your campaign organize help uh left whoa I okay I do know no matter what political stripe you are we feel that sense of being stuck in this city no matter whether you are a parent getting to the park and it looks scruffy whether you're stuck in traffic or stuck waiting for affordable housing we're stuck together so whether you're left right center doesn't matter let's come together and that's Somali mother's saying just touch me so much a few days ago then if we come together we can man a crack in the sky wow but we have to come together to mend the cracks in the city and we can do it we can bring back that City of Hope that my my parents immigrated to Canada for we can take better care of each other we can bring back a caring City that's who we are let's do it together all of us no matter Left Right Center so you mentioned working together a lot but there are also a lot of candidates uh in this sort of campaign how do you uh plan to distinguish yourself in particular from you know someone like Josh Matlow many people have sort of thought perhaps he was the more Progressive candidate so far in the race how do you plan to distinguish yourself from that campaign uh well we all have wonderful ideas candidates have good ideas and it would be wonderful that we actually listen to each other's ideas reject those that you don't support say yes be strong enough to say yes that's not a bad idea at all why not do this together yes one of us will become the mayor hopefully it's me choose me and I will be the mayor and we will work together uh yes there are different candidates have different approaches but surely we don't have to uh go after each other so much being divisive and negative is not who I am that's not where we can find power that's not where hope comes from let's do this together I think I covered the waterfront yeah that's okay I will not override the power of counsel remember 50 plus one is what could make a difference not two-thirds one-third one-quarter whatever the percentage is no that's not what democracy is about if city council said no and majority majority of City councils say no I'm not going to say yes to something like that that's not fair that's not democratic the what I will have a lot to say about that but I want to remind some folks that may remember okay you some of you are a lot younger than I am but you may remember I still found I still found some files in the basement of my house that's called take down the Gardner task force they were shared by the then City councilor Mr Jack Layton and I believe we can build a lot more housing in that land but I will have a full response to that because that is not a simple question but I mean I don't want to give you a simple answer for that because this multi aspect of that piece of gardener that I could talk about that will take you 10 that will take me five minutes but well four elevated or not yeah give me the time to explain in full uh a bit later okay I'm not worried about splitting votes I'm worried about uh what the Mom feels today tonight went after paying rent there's not a whole lot left that they have to find a food bank I'm worried about them I'm worried about folks tonight that can't find a shelter because the weather is going to get colder over a hundred people can't find shelter and they're using TDC as our shelter that's what I'm worried about sorry I just one more quick question Doug Ford has already said that the city doesn't need a lefty running the city um do you have any concern about the fact that you may be running against a former opponent from the outside well I ran together with Mr Ford with Doug Ford and uh in 2014. we have some things in common so other things not I am sure Mr Ford respect democracy I am sure since he said he's going to stay away that he will honor his word and um Vita premiere not a campaign manager for a certain campaign candidate I think I've exhausted people [Laughter] uh join me we have a little room there it's a very Chinese thing don't mind me saying if you want to grab a bite we have food inside dim sum I believe okay yeah we're good thank you"},
  {"link": 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sE1tra0B9oE', "transcript": "uh happening right now at 9 34 Merrell Canada Josh Matlow making a policy announcement regarding Transit left tweaker significant cuts that have meant delays for trontonians across our city who are waiting on the subway platform and for the bus every day this is a service that people rely on every single day to get to appointments to get to school to get to work to get to where they need to go Toronto's recent budget left the TTC at 91 percent of pre-pandemic levels it went further from the recent 96 percent that it was at previously these Cuts disproportionately affect some of Toronto's most underserved communities it affects North York Scarborough Etobicoke it affects our city in a way that the tmu Toronto metropolitan university did a study recently that showed that the service levels on 39 of these routes are going to be experiencing 10 percent delays in waiting times and these lines travel through some of the most underserved and Transit poor communities I'm very happy to announce today that as a as your mayor I'm going to be reversing these cuts and this campaign may be the only campaign that can actually Source funding and demonstrate how we're going to do it in the first year I'm going to be investing 50 million dollars from our City Works fund to immediately reverse the fund the cuts to uh toward pre-pandemic levels then in the subsequent years we're going to be investing 180 million dollars annually from a combination of the City Works fund and what I recently announced the commercial corporate parking Levy the climate action Levy now this is a meaningful step toward ensuring that people who live on Victoria Park on Dufferin on Jane on Queen Keel routes across the city on lines two on lines four people who rely on the TTC every day are not waiting longer and the reason that I want to do this immediately is because we can't wait any longer to reverse these cuts and invest and improve our Transit System in fact what the former Administration did along with the TDC I thought was Reckless and irresponsible by cutting the TTC as the pandemic waned it was the opposite of what we should do when it comes to proving a good business model imagine if a restaurant had decided as the pandemic waned to provide you crappy service and Hike the prices on the menu nobody would go back to that restaurant if we want to encourage ridership back onto the TDC meet our climate crisis goals provide service that people can rely on feel safer on and can afford better then we need to invest in transit and that's what I intend to do thank you very much how many times anyway yeah so um we're not going to over commit the City Works fund and we are you know counting every dollar that we're investing the reason that I need to use the City Works fund initially is because the commercial uh parking lot Levy uh realistically based on staff projections won't be ready to implement for at least a year to 18 months so we need to begin by using the City Works fund as the 50 million dollar Investments but in subsequent years as we can use the levy then that will begin along with the City Works fund to continue the 180 million dollar annual investment to make sure that we bring service back to where it was pre-pandemic on the TDC and the reason we're doing this is because can't wait any longer week wait any longer to improve service on the TTC just like trontonians can't wait any longer on the platform or for their bus and frankly the longer that anybody Waits on the platform or by a bus late at night means that it's less safe for them it's less reliable for them and it's not good enough service for torontonians that's an incredibly thoughtful and poignant question sir uh the question was uh should the province and the federal government uh step in and provide more funds um I certainly uh you know call on other levels of government in particular the provincial government uh to get back into the business of uh funding the TDC with sustainable and ongoing uh operating uh funding it is it is bizarre and unsustainable that the TTC is uniquely uh funded by roughly 75 percent of its Revenue coming through the fare box that's not fair to Riders and it's not really a responsible way and sustainable way to fund Transit that being said though unlike some other campaigns I just in good conscience I can't just make announcements uh about how I'm going to force other levels of government to fund the TTC or fund social housing or bail out our budget because they have not demonstrated with any evidence that they intend to do so today they've not demonstrated that they're going to upload the gardener or the DVP today and that's why we need to get our own house in order to make sure that we move forward with improving Transit and services because torontonians can't wait a bit uh we have seen some other candidates in recent days come out with some high profile endorsements from the likes of former mayors and sitting MPS and even an Oscar winner and to my knowledge I don't know that you have that level of endorsements correct me on that if you like uh but what do those endorsements say and and what is a lack of them for other candidates I mean for the strength of those campaigns yeah I mean I I I recognize that um there there are different approaches to politics and there's more establishment or institutional approaches to to politics um you know the endorsements uh that you know I will announce will be from people who I'm proud to be affiliated with and certainly have a lot of respect for and you'll you'll hear names coming out over the next several weeks but truth be told the the most important endorsement uh for this campaign when it comes to what I value are are people like the people standing behind me trontonians who care about this city who believe in Toronto a better Toronto as possible and um so we're working really hard to seek the endorsement of roughly three million people across the city was but adding that money now is a difficult task anyway it's a it's a very difficult task but it's a necessary task like I recognize that um you know when when we win the election uh we'll have a victory party and it'll be a wonderful celebration with torontonians and then the very next day uh my Administration is going to have to focus uh squarely on addressing uh both the budget shortfall uh the budget pressure over the next 10 years and the need to improve services that torontonians have seen declining for far too many years and they rely on every day and that's why we're going to have to make difficult but honest and necessary choices and again like unlike some of the other campaigns I would I would respectfully suggest um I'm being upfront with the need for Revenue the need to address the property tax rate which has not been keeping up with the uh the service reductions and the need to fund them so that we provide those services to torontonians I announced the the corporate the commercial social parking lot Levy because I recognize that we can bring in significant funds toward our climate crisis schools along with improving the CDC and I also you know disagree with wasting hundreds of millions if not over a billion dollars on rebuilding a small section of an expressway that's least used when we have an alternate option of putting it at the service still connecting the DVP and the rest of the gardener but then reinvesting those funds toward not only the services that I'm talking about today but frankly fixing roads across the city that have potholes so I intend to manage the budget in a way that isn't you know based on political projects or you know sort of what what might feel good that moment or even what would be helpful for a press conference I'm going to be managing the budget in a responsible way that actually directs funds toward the services that we've seen declining for far too many years uh you already had a few times yes essentially an extension of Europe and more money towards yes so um I I appreciate that another candidate uh followed our lead and announced a tenant protection program and I respect that I would encourage every candidate running the Spy election to stand up for attendance as I have for many years uh but as I said earlier uh to earn the trust of trontonians it you can't just announce what you're going to do you need to demonstrate how you're going to deliver it so um you know I identified real dollars from real funds to be able to invest in our tenant uh Protection Program um the challenge with the um you know basing any any commitment or promise on the vacant home tax and and trust me because I actually looked into this as a potential option for our own campaign the reason we decided not to is because there are no there are no projections from staff as to how much revenue will come in in fact the research is happening right now as to even how many vacant homes we have in the city of Toronto so if we don't know that number we don't have any credible source as to how much revenue it would bring in and if the ultimate goal of that tax is to actually make itself redundant because the goal is about decreasing the number of vacant homes rather than bringing in Revenue I don't see realistically how you can have an ongoing program uh based on attacks that you don't know how many vacant homes there are how much money it will bring in and frankly a tax that you actually want to get rid of eventually if you're successful with it so um I would just I would encourage if I can provide even some friendly advice to that campaign um they should research that that uh potent that that tax a little better because they'll find that it's actually not a credible way to fund what they promised you're welcome thank you by the way thank you very much everyone all right that is Merrell Canada Josh Matlow talking about his plan to reinvest in the TTC taking 50 million dollars from the City Works fund to reach pre-pandemic levels particularly in underserved areas he names streets like Jane Keo and Dufferin and soon after that about a year later he'll probably bring in about 180 million dollars per year not just from City funds but also from his corporate parking Levy which he says probably not going to be in place until a year from now if he does win the top job"},
  {"link": 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjtzgnfIFZI', "transcript": "and we want to take you live now to mayoral candidate Josh matlau making a community safety campaign announcement we'll listen in live [Applause] I've been waiting for somebody to tell my wife Melissa that for so long thank you Lori so much uh Lori inspires me and I can just I can tell you that I believe that our city is the vehicle but our communities are the driver when it comes to fulfilling their Ambitions and their dreams here in Oakwood Vaughn and over in little Jamaica Lori is one of the leaders let's hear for Lori [Applause] thank you for far too long under the last two Administrations we've seen our services decline whether it be snow clearing whether it be meaningful investment into Social Services whether it be trying to get our kids into a Rec program it feels sometimes like you're playing Olympic Games as you're clicking on that button when it comes to safety and reliability on the TTC when it comes to even getting the roads paved we can do a lot better and I believe that a better Toronto is possible I wanted Toronto that is safe I want a city that is Affordable I want a city that works I hear from too many young people who cannot afford to pay the rent too many older adults who can't afford to pay their mortgage and too many people who don't even have a home at all we need to focus on them to make the city work for all of us and there are too many people I hear from every day who won't even take the TTC anymore they don't feel safe they see people who need a home who are on well who need our support and there's been too many violent incidents on the TTC and in our neighborhoods and I believe that we can do a lot better these tragedies that we've experienced on the TTC are preventable and the first thing we need to understand is that while these tragedies have been occurring on the TTC the root causes of violence doesn't come from the TDC these are complex issues but if we focus on real solutions we can get results when people are grappling with poverty with trauma with racism with addiction with economic disadvantage they need the supports proactively to prevent violence from occurring in the first place and I'll tell you when I when I spoke when I've spoken with moms with other people who have lost their loved ones their kids without exception they tell me that they would far rather see violence be prevented in the first place then simply react to it afterward s [Applause] so the TTC will be safe when our communities are safe [Applause] and I believe for far too long we've been putting too much responsibility on the police to do what trained experts professionals can be doing to be better positioned to get results to prevent violence from happening in the first place to address to address mental health trauma to identify individuals who have the potential of violence and de-escalate a situation before it becomes a tragedy in the first place foreign we have a shelter system that has been described as safe indoor spaces but the very people who rely on them don't describe them that way we need more and better and safer beds and spaces so that people don't have to go into the TDC for shelter in the first place [Applause] so I'm announcing today that we are no longer going to be asking the police to do everything the police should be doing what they're best at but we need to begin investing in training professionals to do what they're positioned best position to do so at a time when we are facing not only violence on the TDC and in our neighborhoods we are also facing an unprecedented budget pressure at the city of Toronto any candidate anyone who's running to be your mayor cannot earn your trust if they announce plans that aren't funded so I'm announcing as your mayor we're going to create the community health and safety fund and we're going to finance that by stabilizing the annual police budget that budget is 1.16 billion dollars by stabilizing that budget over the next three years we will free up 115 million dollars to invest in preventing violence and crime in the first place we're going to be transferring the responsibilities of the police when it comes to responding and preventing violent crime in our TDC in our neighborhoods to train professionals who know how to do it who have the expertise and knowledge to do it and I can tell you I talked to Frontline officers who tell me the very same thing these officers tell me that they're not Public Health nurses they're not youth workers oh they should be doing what they should be doing and the experts and professionals who can prevent violence should be doing what they're doing but the money needs to follow the service and again with unprecedented budget pressures with a 1.5 billion dollar shortfall in this budget we have to make decisions we have to make choices and we need to start investing in the services that have been underfunded for many years and I'm going to work with the auditor general to support the Toronto Police Services Board to do what every other service in the city of Toronto has been asked to do whether it be child care services Recreation and more parks it's time for the police budget to be stabilized so that we can invest in preventing violence in the first place [Applause] it's time to do things differently it's time to do things differently because what we know and this is an arguable no matter the polarizing debates and the hyperbole that we hear from some the approach that the city has been taking for far too long is not working we're still losing our kids we're hearing more and more people who won't even use the TTC in the first place and if the approach that the city was taking was working we wouldn't be having this conversation today as your mayor we're going to take an approach that is evidence-based honest fully funded and will deliver results and for those for those of you reporters at the back I'm very happy to take any questions you might have thank you well good morning uh hi Josh Andrew from CTV I good to see you I wanted I know this may not be as let's for lack of a better word let's call it sexy as some of the uh let's say endorsements you've gotten so far but looking at the announcement and the release that we got yes can you tell a bit of the the nitty-gritty of why it's better to go in your mind at the root of the problem looking at the studies looking at whether it's from NYU the other things that you put in your release why when someone on face value will think oh you want to cut from the police budget to make the city safer that sounds oxymoronic on face value but you say you have evidence to support why and can you tell a little bit about why absolutely you know the city's own pilot where we have uh interventions teams who are trained professionals uh Mental Health crisis responders uh you know people who are trained and knowledgeable in that field unlike many of our our Frontline police officers as well as they are um through that pilot we've already had about 1 500 calls and um and 78 78 of them uh didn't involve any police at all in other words the evidence is showing us even from our own our own pilot that we are more successful when we have trained professionals who can help de-escalate a situation rather than see the tragedies that we've seen far too often and sometimes even involving police if we're to be honest with ourselves um you know over a decade ago the province commissioned a report called the roots of Youth violence report by Alvin curling and Roy McMurtry and you know so sadly so many of those recommendations if they had been invested in over a decade ago there is good reason to believe that we would be in a better situation today than we are and what I want to do is Mayor what I'm determined to do as mayor is finally make those Investments so that our con our kids can be safer and grow up in a safer City you know even uh Toronto's example um you know for several years we saw even a decline in uh in the police force that we have the number of officers we had but we also saw a decline in in violent crime so in other words there's no causal relationship even between the number of officers we have and the amount of crime that we experience what I want to see done is have a police force that does what it's good at but I also want to make sure that we have evidence-based programs that are fully funded and able to actually prevent crime before it begins in the first place what we haven't done well enough is invest in the proactive preventative side but the police budget has continued to balloon year after year including last year so you know this isn't really a contest between the two this is really about making up for lost time and I intend to make meaningful investments in doing so this morning it always used to be room for Applause break after questions thank you uh you said fully funded as a follow-up all of the candidates that have had either announcements thus far or put out five point plans four point plans how many points they want to put on a plan yeah are you do for the voters that are looking to be potentially figuring out their vote are you trying to differentiate yourself not only on policy but also saying it's fully funded because 1.3 billion dollars for security doors on a TTC is one thing it sounds good but for what you're planning to do everything you say thus far is going to be is funded no problem I'm I'm not trying to do anything I'm I'm just doing it um you know the uh you know there's just been you know far too many years you know dating back to smart track announcements in 2014 and all these these these announcements that uh sound good for elections but they really are they're campaign employees they uh they're they're meant to convince people that there's some amazing plan uh but I just I don't believe that one can earn the Public's trust without being able to demonstrate how you're going to fund it and actually uh see it through to fruition so whether it be the City Works fund that I announced when I first launched uh to uh begin improving services in our city and today demonstrating that the way to prevent crime is to use the existing budget we have but in a more balanced way to stabilize where uh budgets have ballooned and start investing in areas that have been underfunded for too many years and here's the reality the city has a 1.5 billion dollar shortfall the the other levels of government you may have read about this they did not come to the city's rescue they did not bail out the budget so the reality is the city is facing um you know a number of crises but certainly a big financial crisis and it's facing a 46 billion dollar budget pressure over the next 10 years this is not the time for any candidate to just kind of come out with some plan and make up that they're going to pay for it without actually demonstrating to the public that they have a realistic way to do it so listen I know that when I talk about a dedicated property tax uh toward improving Services you know that's going to get people talking I get that when I talk about stabilizing the police budget there will be some people like Doug Ford who may have a disagreement with me I say respectfully important to be upfront and honest not only about what our vision is for the city but how we're going to pay for it so that when I'm elected if trontonians decide to choose me when thank you that's up to Toronto that's up to Toronto but I'm you know I'm willing I'm willing to put my trust in torontonians that they want an honest conversation about how to get results whether it be everything from fixing our roads to improving Services uh to clearing our snow to helping the unhoused get homes to helping everyone in our middle class actually be able to afford a home to support people who can't make the rent to make sure that violence is prevented rather than simply experienced on our TTC in our neighborhoods and I believe trentonians want that and I and I believe that they expect all right we've been listening in to mayoral candidate Josh matlau providing a community safety announcement much to the Delight of his supporters who are cheering him on saying that if he's elected mayor he would establish a community health and safety fund and in order to pay for that he would stabilize the police budget for at least three years he says that you shouldn't really trust any mayoral candidate who cannot say how they're going to fund any of their proposals going forward he would invest that money take away the responsibility from police in establishing safety on the TDC and invest in trained professionals"},

  {"link": 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUdB_THPJe8', "transcript": "okay we want to take you live to mayoral candidate Mark Saunders in Scarborough discussing his plan to protect Toronto's Future Let's listen in live across the city right across our cities right across our neighborhoods even on TTC property we are seeing that this issue has magnified it has not decreased in fact about a month ago my wife and I were talking to one of our sons who was on a bus and right on the bus somebody came on and started to light up a meth pipe so this is a kind of disorder that we're having our cities moving in the wrong direction and it's impacting absolutely everybody whether it's people that are dying as a result of it whether it's a mom father or a son picking up needles in the park or whether or not in some neighborhoods people have naloxone kits at their front door over the last three years when we talk about drug overdoses it has skyrocketed compared to the three years prior to that if we looked at a time frame between October of 2021 and September of 2022 500 overdose deaths have been recorded and they're not just numbers they're mothers their fathers Aunts Uncles their sons and daughters one of the things that we need to do and one of the things that I will do as mayor is I will immediately call on Council to stop the irresponsible decision of requesting the federal government decriminalize all drugs especially when we're talking about our youth our people between the ages and 12 to 17. it's like we're giving up and we can't give up we can do so much better as a city that's why as mayor I want to introduce a comprehensive and compassionate plan that will have Holistic Solutions not just solutions that look at it from the the direction it's going in now so first one of the things I'll do is I will revise the Toronto overdose action plan to focus on treatment and recovery and make sure that we utilize fundings in those capacities versus just the supervised sites next I'll set up a working group and service providers and experts to develop strategies to support treatment and Recovery as a priority third I'll work with the province to create a more impatient option for those in need of treatments options like 24 7 emergency intakes referrals to community health providers in connection to care teams such as social workers and other staffs that will be necessary and fourth since Toronto is the epicenter for this particular situation it's important that we have Federal and provincial involvement to make sure that we can get the right numbers of beds and staff in accordance to help resolve this problem enough isn't enough we have to make sure that we do everything we possibly can for some of our most vulnerable members of our community and we have to do it the right way and that's why as mayor with my experience I believe that I can move this discussion and this issue in the right direction to a much more improved healthy vibrant city the city that we all can move forward in that can be prosperous and provide the opportunities for so many of us to live the Canadian dream and having said that I'll take some questions morning sir um affordable housing is another major issue in the city with plenty of people with low income with low income needing a place to live uh what do you plan to do to create more and help those dealing with bad landlords yeah so good question and I I can tell you there is a very large uh platform that I have for that today though keeping it in the strand of when we talk about substance use one of the things that's key and critical is making sure we have the right resources and they're included in that is is having an opportunity for transition houses so people right now that are dependent on drugs but we know that when we turn that direction around and these people now become members of communities that can now be able to live properly and have family and and get a job so included in that affordability it has so many strands and we'll have the opportunity to to later discuss that on on a platform the idea of a rent bank or tenants do you have a reaction to that you know within my platform there is the affordable ownership as well too a totally different direction uh certainly not uh at the expense of gouging every member of the community to pay more taxes uh my plan is reducing taxes or keeping taxes as low as possible because I understand that the taxpayer is being reached into their pockets from so many people we have to make sure that we we do it we do it right look at the existing funds that are on the table right now how can we modify and change and make sure we can deliver the models better and in the discussion I'm talking about treatment and Recovery are so critical in order for us to be successful and I'm not seeing that right now and as mayor I'll make sure that that is at top of top of mind okay thank you very much all right we've been listening into former police chief Mark Saunders announcing his plan for Toronto's future"},

  {"link": 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQbSRmQhugo', "transcript": "we're gonna go live now to mayoral candidate Brad Bradford who's making an announcement let's listen in all right everyone good to go okay well good morning everyone uh thank you for being here on March 20th 2023 a 21 year old man was murdered in broad daylight at four o'clock in the afternoon in the parking lot of Fairview Mall on a busy Saturday one of the individuals apprehended and charged with this murder was also arrested in February of 2021 on firearm charges possession of stolen property in excess of five thousand dollars and in possession of schedule one drugs for the purposes of trafficking he failed to comply with the terms of his release order and as we all know too well and continue to grieve in March a 16 year old a teenage boy was murdered in an unprovoked attack by a 25 year old man of no fixed address only weeks after having been sentenced to a two-year probation order for sexual assault the accused had an extensive criminal history here in Ontario including 20 different charges for sexual assault assaulting a police officer Mischief or damaging an ankle monitor assaulting and uttering threats when it comes to policing bail Toronto's grade is unequivocally a fail we need less talk and more action to do something about this and the question has to be asked why does this keep happening the answer is very simple hardly any of the 17 Toronto police divisions employ police officers who sold job is to ensure that people out on bail abide by their Court mandated orders of the 44 gun related murders in Toronto last year 17 of those arrested and charged with these homicides were on bail at the time that they were committed seven of them for firearms related offenses this system is failing and violent offenders know it nobody is watching to ensure that they comply with the law so what's the solution every time this happens politicians call on the federal government to move on bail reform it's not quite thoughts and prayers but if we're being honest it's not too far from it either I've done it too because the federal government needs to be a part of the solution but there's also room for Less Talk and more action as mayor I will establish dedicated bail compliance units by working with the Toronto Police Service to keep tabs on alleged criminals who the courts have released into our community this is a critical expansion of Toronto's community policing presence with 68 new officers across Toronto's 17 police divisions these bail compliance units would be tasked exclusively with engaging monitoring deterring and enforcing compliance of the law with individuals in the community released on bail torontonians should expect their elected officials at all levels of government to prioritize their safety and their security yesterday's leaders who built the status quo are not the answer we need real action today to restore the safety to our communities and I want to bring action to City Hall be a strong mayor of leadership and to hold people accountable and to get the job done Toronto we can and will do better and we mil will make our community safer for everybody happy to take any of your questions well I think we make it very clear to the police board and they are well aware of the issue with Bail Enforcement we see it week after week here in the city we need to stand up a bail Compliance Unit to make sure that we have the resources available to do those checks to stop the continuation of crime before it happens so you know we'll have that conversation with the police board I think it's also very important to other levels of government as well we all need to come to the table to come to ground on this know exactly what you're saying we will be securing the funding to stand up a program to hire the additional resources 68 officers across the 17 divisions to to stand up a bail Compliance Unit I think that's really important I'm I'm sure the police board would understand that and you know what in putting this policy together I've talked to superintendents I've talked to inspectors I've talked to staff sergeants and I've talked to constables and they all agree this is needed right now in Toronto is a huge amount of resources a starting cop makes 100 Grand plus as much in benefits and other things how much would that cost and how do you pay for when the city has a 1.5 billion dollar budget so we anticipate the program will be 16 million dollars in the first year uh that includes 5.1 million dollars in annual costs for salary and benefits uh 3.6 million dollar annual cost for Fleet and support uh and a seven million dollar cost to stand up the program for the first time so that's that's the ballpark number um four officers on average per division 17 divisions and you know the premier has been clear time and time again that Community safety is a priority the premier has spoken about that extensively during this election and when I'm elected mayor I will sit down at the table with the premier to have this conversation about how we're going to stand up this much needed Pro program bail compliance units here in the city of Toronto yes this this would be 68 additional officers there is a cost associated with that as I've just outlined very specifically but again Community safety has to be a priority we have this challenge with the justice of the peace in the provincial jurisdiction um and with all the conditions that are that are imposed on um alleged offenders who are out on bail but we do not have the resources to enforce that and time and time again the system fails torontonians as we see uh with repeat offenders who are involved in very serious offenses and the Toronto police do not have the resources to do the Bail Enforcement and that's why we need a dedicated bail Compliance Unit and I would imagine you know the premier would be very interested in making sure that those resources are in place to keep our communities safe and support the Toronto police in that effort and then suddenly commit a random attack how would these officers stop something like that right now we do not have the resources in place to adequately adequately enforce the restrictions imposed with bail and so they do that there there should be a lot more work done on that front and we see time and time again people are not complying with the restrictions imposed as part of bail and so having a dedicated resource unit to do that uh would improve the situation is it is it going to be a Panacea to make sure that this never happens again no but it is a real concrete step that we could take today and as a mayor that I would take here in Toronto to improve the situation another thing um what I'm doing right now is responding to a community safety crisis here in the city of Toronto and as a mayor I will be committed to less talk and more action it's one thing to call for a meeting with the Prime Minister we saw the premiers months ago all 13 write a letter council is engaged in that as well the letter writing campaigns are over we are going to take real action and that's why this is a real proposal to stand up something that would make a tangible Improvement for Community safety here in Toronto foreign yeah I mean I would point to the hundreds of folks who have committed infractions serious violent offenses well on bail I would point to the uh the individuals who are arrested time and time again reoffending with with serious firearm related offenses that translates into more crime and I would say this is a credible response something that is needed in my conversations and discussions with folks across the city this needs to be responded to we can point to the federal government and ask for bail reform as we have for years but the city of Toronto needs to take action in conjunction with the pro with the province to stand up a program that responds to the challenges that we're facing right now is based on the presumption of innocence how how much power will these compliance officers have 24 hours a day right now we're doing a combination of nothing to very little so these officers will be enforcing the conditions that are imposed with with an individual on bail and that's part of the agreement when the the provincial justice of a piece puts those restrictions in place the expectation is that they are enforced today very very often they are not and that's because the resources don't exist and they're not in place to do that and time and time again we see folks who are out on bail that continue to reoffend and often it ends up in in more violent crime here in Toronto and and people are tired of that and I am tired of that as well and as a strong mayor of action I'm putting a real proposal on the table to address it searched spending a million dollars these are research is there something is there you're facing this on something or is it just something you've come up there are other jurisdictions that do a far better job uh enforcing bail conditions than the city of Toronto and that's because the reality is we have a hard time doing any of that you know again uh justice of the peace at the Province imposes these conditions but it falls to the Toronto police to do some of that enforcement and again my conversations at the superintendent level the inspector level the staff sergeant level and and constables those resources are not in place to do that and so if we want to improve Community safety outcomes if we recognize that there is a problem of folks out on bail reoffending in very serious matters um we have to put resources in place to address that we've been listening to mayoral candidate Brad Bradford on the campaign Trail announcing that if elected mayor he will establish a dedicated bail Compliance Unit to work with Toronto police to keep tabs on alleged criminals who the courts have released into our community he would do that by adding 68 new officers to Toronto's police's division"},
